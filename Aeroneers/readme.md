## AeroCAN

AeroCAN is all about removing the attention-load of the race car driver and enhancing a racers ability to get around track. It accomplishes this by reading in data from an onboard accelerometer, processing the signal with a digital signal processing algorithm, and controlling the action of control surfaces mounted on a motor vehicle.
